# SQLI-Vulnerability-Detection-and-Prevention
# This repository focuses on detecting and preventing SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerabilities using advanced machine learning techniques. It includes a comprehensive dataset featuring over 12566 SQL queries from diverse sources, categorized by various SQLI types such as error-based, union-based, and time-based injections. The project also implements and evaluates several Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms to enhance SQLI detection accuracy, aiming to bolster security measures against potential threats.
# Explore the code, dataset, and models to understand the intricacies of SQLI vulnerabilities and how to effectively mitigate them.
